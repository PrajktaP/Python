Q1. Write a program using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 50.
Expected Output:

# seeing a % at the end after running this code
# Your Python script runs and prints 1 2 3 ... 50 (with a space in between).
# Then it exits.
# The terminal prompt returns â€” and depending on your shell, it may use % as the prompt character
# print()  # adds a newline so the zsh prompt appears cleanly on the next line
