1. Install the MySQL Connector:
The mysql-connector-python module is required. Install it using pip:
Code

     pip install mysql-connector-python

2. Import the Module:
In your Python script, import the module:
Python

     import mysql.connector

3. Establish a Connection:
Use the mysql.connector.connect() method to create a connection object. You'll need to provide your MySQL server's credentials: 
Python

     mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="your_host",       # Usually "localhost" for local servers
       user="your_username",   # Your MySQL username
       password="your_password", # Your MySQL password
       database="your_database"  # The database you want to connect to
     )
Replace placeholders with your actual credentials.

4. Create a Cursor:
A cursor object is used to execute SQL queries. Create it using:
Python

     mycursor = mydb.cursor()

5. Execute Queries:
Use the cursor's execute() method to run SQL commands:
Python

     mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
Replace "SELECT \* FROM your\_table" with your desired SQL query.

6. Fetch Results:
Use methods like fetchall(), fetchone(), or fetchmany() to retrieve query results:
Python

     results = mycursor.fetchall()  # Gets all results
     for row in results:
       print(row)

7. Close Connections:
Close the cursor and connection objects after you're done:
Python

     mycursor.close()
     mydb.close()
